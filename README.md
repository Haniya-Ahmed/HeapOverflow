# HeapOverflow
This repo contains code for team project done in CS2043- Software Engineering class.
The idea was inspired by StackOverflow. We created this application in Java with goal for UNB computer science students to be able to ask questions to each other and look for help on an online platform. To access the content on Heap Overflow, profiles will be created and will be associated with each student's UNB profile. Heap Overflow will include features such as being able to post questions and receive help from peers, share interesting articles and news stories relevant to computer science, and allow professors to see topics that students are struggling with and need more help with. A filtered search system will be used so students can look up posts with relevant tags to that which they are looking for. Users will be able to interact with posted content including commenting on/answer questions and upvoting answers they found to be the most helpful.
